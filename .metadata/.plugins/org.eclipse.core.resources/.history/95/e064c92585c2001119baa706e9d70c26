/**
 * Base class providing the adapter to populate pages inside of
 * a {@link ViewPager}.  You will most likely want to use a more
 * specific implementation of this, such as
 * {@link android.support.v4.app.FragmentPagerAdapter} or
 * {@link android.support.v4.app.FragmentStatePagerAdapter}.
 *
 * <p>When you implement a PagerAdapter, you must override the following methods
 * at minimum:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #instantiateItem(ViewGroup, int)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #destroyItem(ViewGroup, int, Object)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #getCount()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #isViewFromObject(View, Object)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>PagerAdapter is more general than the adapters used for
 * {@link android.widget.AdapterView AdapterViews}. Instead of providing a
 * View recycling mechanism directly ViewPager uses callbacks to indicate the
 * steps taken during an update. A PagerAdapter may implement a form of View
 * recycling if desired or use a more sophisticated method of managing page
 * Views such as Fragment transactions where each page is represented by its
 * own Fragment.</p>
 *
 * <p>ViewPager associates each page with a key Object instead of working with
 * Views directly. This key is used to track and uniquely identify a given page
 * independent of its position in the adapter. A call to the PagerAdapter method
 * {@link #startUpdate(ViewGroup)} indicates that the contents of the ViewPager
 * are about to change. One or more calls to {@link #instantiateItem(ViewGroup, int)}
 * and/or {@link #destroyItem(ViewGroup, int, Object)} will follow, and the end
 * of an update will be signaled by a call to {@link #finishUpdate(ViewGroup)}.
 * By the time {@link #finishUpdate(ViewGroup) finishUpdate} returns the views
 * associated with the key objects returned by
 * {@link #instantiateItem(ViewGroup, int) instantiateItem} should be added to
 * the parent ViewGroup passed to these methods and the views associated with
 * the keys passed to {@link #destroyItem(ViewGroup, int, Object) destroyItem}
 * should be removed. The method {@link #isViewFromObject(View, Object)} identifies
 * whether a page View is associated with a given key object.</p>
 *
 * <p>A very simple PagerAdapter may choose to use the page Views themselves
 * as key objects, returning them from {@link #instantiateItem(ViewGroup, int)}
 * after creation and adding them to the parent ViewGroup. A matching
 * {@link #destroyItem(ViewGroup, int, Object)} implementation would remove the
 * View from the parent ViewGroup and {@link #isViewFromObject(View, Object)}
 * could be implemented as <code>return view == object;</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>PagerAdapter supports data set changes. Data set changes must occur on the
 * main thread and must end with a call to {@link #notifyDataSetChanged()} similar
 * to AdapterView adapters derived from {@link android.widget.BaseAdapter}. A data
 * set change may involve pages being added, removed, or changing position. The
 * ViewPager will keep the current page active provided the adapter implements
 * the method {@link #getItemPosition(Object)}.</p>
